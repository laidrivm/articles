# What I’m doing now

## Found a job, going through a probation

Onboarding into a new chapter of my career - as Head of Engineering [at Mojam](https://mojam.co/). Already hiring [a Vue front-end lead](https://mojam.co/careers/front-end-team-lead/), [a senior PHP/Laravel back-end engineer](https://mojam.co/careers/senior-php-developer-2/), and a junior QA engineer. If you speak Russian and meet the criteria, please apply. I'd be glad to consider you for the positions.

## Moving to Portugal

My project was approved for the Portugal startup program. Зublished [a guide](https://laidrivm.com/portuguese-startup-visa) about the process. Waiting for the consulate to issue the appropriate visa. Hope to move with my wife and parrot to a Greater Lisbon Area by December. Open to your advice and recommendations!

## Developing Mellon

It is a local-first password manager I submitted to the startup program. I [published a prototype](https://mellon.laidrivm.com/), and [write articles](https://laidrivm.com/how-i-built-mellon-part-1) about how I'm building it.

## Reading Kleppmann and Spider-man

I'm rereading [that book with the boar](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) and reading Untold Tales of Spider-Man for the first time — a huge comics series.

## Picked up a DevSecOps course

All my knowledge about infrastructure, except for the Linux theory and practice, I acquired as a self-taught guy. Despite my experience administration k8s cluster or setting up proxy package registry, it will be useful for me to gather my knowledge and get new ideas to improve CI/CD pipelines and overall security.

## Living a family life

In January, Nastya and I got married. We spend a lot of time together, travel, and love each other. In February, a pineapple green-cheeked parakeet flew to us from the street. We kept him and named Zhablik. Now we can't imagine how we lived without this sweet little pie.

## Previously

### Finished a podcasts course

I was learning from [the most famous studio](https://course.libolibo.me/podcast-course) of Russian-language podcasts. I had been so inspired by David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs that I was thinking of recording episodes regarding that topic. Yet, I couldn't convert my insiration into a single episode during the course. Hope to fix it one day.

### Looking for a job

Looking for a fully remote position or one with an office in Portugal. Seeking for CTO, Head of Engineering or Engineering Manager roles. Hands-on with the JS stack. Check [my LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vladimir-lazarev_portugal-croatia-remote-activity-7333039345244835841-sPya) for the details.

## Finished a comics course

My wife and I took [an offline comics course](https://woopwoopschool.com/comicscourse). As a result, [I published my first comics, RU](https://t.me/laidrivm_pub/626) — an adaptation of the investigation of istories.media about the connection between Telegram and the russian federal security service.

### Learning English

In May, Alvin, my previous tutor, left to learn Python and data analysis. In June, I started studying with Ian. He sends me [Jimmy Carr's shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3SSZeUPznU). I send him [clips with David Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pDTiFkXgEE). Seems we've found common ground. Last time I learned that when brits tap their noses, they mean "keep this secret".

### Reading Polozkova and Graeber

Although they are trying to cancel Vera for [her interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aymb2GzNOPY), I enjoy [Lost and Found book](https://www.vidimbooks.com/polozkova). Meanwhile, I finally started [Bullshit Jobs](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bullshit-Jobs/David-Graeber/9781501143335).
