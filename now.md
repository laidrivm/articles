# What Iâ€™m doing now

## Looking for a job

Wanna move from Serbia to Portugal or Croatia. Looking for a contract in these countries, or a remote one. Hands on in JS stack. Seek for CTO, Head of Engineering or Engineering Manager roles. Check [my LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vladimir-lazarev_portugal-croatia-remote-activity-7333039345244835841-sPya) for the details.

## Trying to get a startup visa

This year's major goal is to get Portugal Startup Visa and launch a product behind it. I've already submitted [an application](https://laidrivm.com/mellon), made [a prototype](https://laidrivm.com/how-i-built-mellon-part-1) and published [a guide](https://laidrivm.com/portuguese-startup-visa). Waiting for the decision.

## Living a family life

In January, Nastya and I got married. We spend a lot of time together, travel, and love each other.

## Raising a parrot

In February, a pineapple green-cheeked parakeet flew to us from the street. We kept him for ourselves and named Zhablik. Now we can't imagine how we lived without this sweet little pie.

## Drawing comics

My wife and I are taking [an offline comics course](https://woopwoopschool.com/comicscourse). It takes 12 hours a week, and there is a project at the end of the month. I'll have to rework pictures display to post the project here on the site, heh.

## Learning English

In May, Alvin, my previous tutor, left to learn Python and data analysis. In June, I started studying with Ian. He sends me [Jimmy Carr's shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3SSZeUPznU). I send him [clips with David Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pDTiFkXgEE). Seems we've found common ground. Last time I learned that when brits tap their noses, they mean "keep this secret".

## Reading Polozkova and Graeber

Although they are trying to cancel Vera for [her interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aymb2GzNOPY), I enjoy [Lost and Found book](https://www.vidimbooks.com/polozkova). Meanwhile, I finally started [Bullshit Jobs](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bullshit-Jobs/David-Graeber/9781501143335).
