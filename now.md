# What I’m doing now

## Looking for a job

Looking for a fully remote position or one with an office in Portugal. Seeking for CTO, Head of Engineering or Engineering Manager roles. Hands-on with the JS stack. Check [my LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vladimir-lazarev_portugal-croatia-remote-activity-7333039345244835841-sPya) for the details.

## Moving to Portugal

My project was approved for the Portugal Startup program. I published [a guide](https://laidrivm.com/portuguese-startup-visa) about the process. Now waiting for 23rd September to apply for the visa.

## Developing Mellon

It is a local-first password manager I submitted to the startup program. I [published a prototype](https://mellon.laidrivm.com/), and [write articles](https://laidrivm.com/how-i-built-mellon-part-1) about how I'm building it.

## Living a family life

In January, Nastya and I got married. We spend a lot of time together, travel, and love each other. In February, a pineapple green-cheeked parakeet flew to us from the street. We kept him and named Zhablik. Now we can't imagine how we lived without this sweet little pie.

## Finished a comics course

My wife and I took [an offline comics course](https://woopwoopschool.com/comicscourse). As a result, [I published my first comics, RU](https://t.me/laidrivm_pub/626) — an adaptation of the investigation of istories.media about the connection between Telegram and the russian federal security service.

## Picked up a podcasts course

I'm learning from [the most famous studio](https://course.libolibo.me/podcast-course) of Russian-language podcasts. I was so inspired by David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs that I'm thinking of recording episodes regarding that topic.

## Reading Kleppmann and Spider-man

I'm rereading [that book with the boar](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) and reading Untold Tales of Spider-Man for the first time — a huge comics series.

## Previously

### Learning English

In May, Alvin, my previous tutor, left to learn Python and data analysis. In June, I started studying with Ian. He sends me [Jimmy Carr's shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3SSZeUPznU). I send him [clips with David Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pDTiFkXgEE). Seems we've found common ground. Last time I learned that when brits tap their noses, they mean "keep this secret".

### Reading Polozkova and Graeber

Although they are trying to cancel Vera for [her interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aymb2GzNOPY), I enjoy [Lost and Found book](https://www.vidimbooks.com/polozkova). Meanwhile, I finally started [Bullshit Jobs](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bullshit-Jobs/David-Graeber/9781501143335).
